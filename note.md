Here's how to use this code
##Step 1: Split the Dataset
Let's assume you have a dataset in CSV format. First, you need to split this dataset into training and testing sets.
##Step 2: Convert to TFRecord Format
Next, you need to convert the split datasets into TFRecord format. TensorFlow uses TFRecord format to efficiently store large amounts of data.
##Step 3: Load and Use TFRecord Dataset in TensorFlow for Training and Evaluation
Once you have the TFRecord files, you can load them and use them in your TensorFlow pipeline.
